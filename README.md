# Portfolio-one
My first portfolio assignment for DIG4639

For this portfolio assignment, I created an exercise app called Get Into It. This exercise app allows you to pick from a list of five different types of duration or repetition exercises to choose from. 

# Repetition Exercise
Repetition Exercises are ones that allow you to count how many "reps" you do. The three repetition exercises available are: ** Push Ups, Jumping Jacks, and Sit Ups **
# Duration Exercise
